Scene: A hospital waiting room, Despair and Anger are discussing a difficult situation.

Despair: (sighing heavily) I just don't know what to do. This is all just so hopeless.

Anger: (frustrated) Don't you dare give up. This is exactly what they want you to do. To just lay down and take it.

Despair: (defeated) What's the point? No matter what I do, it's never going to change.

Anger: (firmly) That's not true. You have to fight. You have to stand up for what's right.

Despair: (weakly) I've tried. I've tried so many times and it's never worked.

Anger: (angrily) That's because you're not doing it right. You're not putting in enough effort. You're not making enough noise.

Despair: (skeptically) How is shouting and throwing things going to solve anything?

Anger: (determined) It gets people's attention. It shows them that you're serious. That you won't just take it lying down.

Despair: (doubtful) I don't know. It just feels so pointless.

Anger: (emphatically) It's not pointless. Every little bit helps. Every voice counts. You can make a difference, but you have to believe in yourself.

Despair: (thinking) Maybe you're right. Maybe I just need to try harder.

Anger: (positively) That's the spirit! And I'll be here to support you every step of the way.

(Despair nods, feeling a sense of determination and confidence from Anger's angry words. They both know that the road ahead will not be easy, but with Anger's encouragement, Despair feels more confident in their ability to overcome their despair and fight for what's right)
