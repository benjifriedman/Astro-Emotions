Scene: A crowded street, Shame and Wrath are walking together.

Shame: (ashamed) I can't believe I let myself get so out of control.

Wrath: (angrily) It's not your fault. You were pushed to the brink.

Shame: (embarrassed) Still, I shouldn't have let my emotions get the best of me. I made a fool of myself.

Wrath: (irritated) The real fools are the ones who pushed you that far. They're the ones who should feel ashamed.

Shame: (defeated) I don't know what to do. I feel like I've lost control of everything.

Wrath: (enraged) You're not the only one. There are so many people out there who are just taking advantage of others. They think they can get away with anything.

Shame: (self-conscious) And what about me? I feel like everyone is judging me, like they know what I did and they're laughing at me.

Wrath: (fiercely) Let them judge. They don't know anything about you. They don't know the struggles you've been through, the pain you've endured.

Shame: (ashamed) But it's not just about me. What about the people I hurt? How can I make it up to them?

Wrath: (unyielding) By standing up for yourself. By showing them that you're not going to take their crap anymore.

Shame: (surprised) You think so?

Wrath: (confidently) I know so. You're strong, and you're not alone. Together, we can take down anyone who tries to bring us down.

Shame: (reinvigorated) You're right. I won't let them get the best of me. I won't let my shame control me anymore.

(Shame and Wrath look at each other, filled with a sense of purpose and determination. Despite their different perspectives, they are united in their desire to fight against the forces that would bring them down)
