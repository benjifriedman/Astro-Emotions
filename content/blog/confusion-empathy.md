Scene: A therapist's office, Confusion and Empathy are discussing a difficult issue.

Confusion: (perplexed) I just don't understand why this is happening to me. I've been feeling so lost and disconnected lately.

Empathy: (sympathetically) That must be really hard for you. I can imagine how confusing and overwhelming that must feel.

Confusion: (frustrated) It's like I don't even know who I am anymore. I used to have a clear sense of my values and what was important to me, but now everything seems so uncertain.

Empathy: (understandingly) That can be a common experience when we're going through big changes or challenges in our lives. It can be scary to feel like the ground beneath us is shifting.

Confusion: (defeated) I just wish I could snap out of it and get back to normal.

Empathy: (supportively) That's understandable, but it's important to remember that this is just a temporary phase. With time and support, you'll find your way back to a sense of clarity and purpose.

Confusion: (hopeful) Do you really think so?

Empathy: (confidently) Absolutely. You're a resilient and strong person, and I have faith in your ability to overcome this.

(Confusion nods, feeling a sense of comfort and relief from Empathy's empathetic words. They both know that the road ahead will not be easy, but with Empathy's support, Confusion feels more confident in their ability to navigate their confusion and find their way forward)
