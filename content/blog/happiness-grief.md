Scene: A park, Happiness and Grief are sitting on a bench together.

Happiness: (smiling) Isn't this a beautiful day? The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the flowers are in full bloom.

Grief: (sadly) I wish I could see it that way. All I see is the emptiness and the pain.

Happiness: (gently) I understand that you're grieving, but it's important to try and find some joy in life, even during the hardest of times.

Grief: (tearfully) It's not that simple. I lost someone I loved deeply. I feel like a part of me has been taken away.

Happiness: (compassionately) I know it's hard, but holding onto the memories of the one you lost and finding ways to honor their life can bring you comfort and joy.

Grief: (thoughtfully) You know, you're right. They lived a full and happy life, and I should celebrate that instead of dwelling on their loss.

Happiness: (encouragingly) That's the spirit! And I'm here to support you every step of the way.

(Grief nods and a small smile begins to form on their face. They look out into the park and begin to see the beauty that Happiness sees. They sit in companionable silence, each finding comfort and solace in the other's presence)
